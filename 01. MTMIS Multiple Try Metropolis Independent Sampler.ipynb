    "- The MTMIS is capable of sampling the two maximums of the target PDF as well as the MTM algorithm does.\n",
    "- We should be careful when choosing the standar deviation for the trial probability distribution. If it's too small, then the y_trials may not reach neither of the maximums of the PDF. On the other hand, if it's too big, the MTMIS will probably need a lot of iterations in order to get a good sampling."
